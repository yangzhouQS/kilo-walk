Build Dart and Flutter apps that talk to each other directly — no public servers, no VPN setup, no NAT punching code — over an encrypted [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) or [Headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) tailnet.

`package:tailscale` embeds upstream Go [`tsnet`](https://pkg.go.dev/tailscale.com/tsnet) and exposes typed Dart APIs for lifecycle, node identity, HTTP, TCP, UDP, TLS, Serve, Funnel, prefs, exit nodes, and diagnostics. Your app authenticates as its own node on the tailnet — users never install or configure a Tailscale client.

> **Status:** `0.3.1`, pre-1.0. The core API is stable enough to build on, but minor versions may include breaking changes until 1.0. Production users are welcome — please [open an issue](https://github.com/danReynolds/tailscale_dart/issues) or [start a discussion](https://github.com/danReynolds/tailscale_dart/discussions) if something blocks you.

## Documentation

The [**developer site**](https://danreynolds.github.io/tailscale_dart/) is the canonical place to browse the package — full guide, examples, architecture diagrams, and a runtime model walkthrough.

## What you can build

- A **Flutter chat or collaboration app** where peers reach each other directly when possible — without you running relay or signaling infrastructure.
- A **headless Dart service** that joins your tailnet and exposes private HTTPS without opening any public port.
- An **on-device dashboard** that calls private internal APIs (Grafana, Home Assistant, internal admin) without a corporate VPN.
- A **shared Funnel endpoint** — publish a local development server to the public internet, terminated with a real cert by Tailscale.
- Anything you'd reach for a [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) or [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/) library for, but you'd rather use Tailscale's identity, ACLs, and DERP fallback than build them yourself.

### When this is the right choice

- You want **app-level networking**, scoped to one process — not system-wide tunnels users have to consent to.
- You want familiar Dart shapes (`http.Client`, byte streams, datagrams) instead of `dart:io.Socket` wrappers around a localhost proxy.
- You're happy to delegate auth, WireGuard, ACLs, MagicDNS, DERP, HTTPS certs, Serve, and Funnel policy to upstream Tailscale.

### When to use something else

- **You need a system-wide VPN.** Use the official Tailscale apps; this package is per-process userspace networking.
- **Windows is a hard requirement today.** v1 is POSIX-only — see [Platform support](#platform-support).
- **You can't run a Go toolchain at build time.** This package compiles upstream tsnet on first build.

## Install

```yaml
dependencies:
  tailscale: ^0.3.1
```

The first `dart run`, `dart test`, or `flutter build` triggers a native build hook that compiles the Go runtime for the target platform. Subsequent builds are cached and only recompile when Go source changes.

Prerequisites:

- Dart SDK 3.10.4 or newer.
- Go 1.25 or newer on `PATH`.
- Native toolchain for the target platform: Xcode for iOS/macOS, Android NDK through Flutter for Android, and a C toolchain for Linux.

## Quick start

```dart
import 'package:tailscale/tailscale.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  Tailscale.init(stateDir: '/app/state');

  final tailscale = Tailscale.instance;
  final status = await tailscale.up(
    hostname: 'dart-node',
    authKey: 'tskey-auth-...',
  );

  print('node: ${status.stableNodeId}');
  print('ipv4: ${status.ipv4}');
}
```

Subsequent launches can call `up()` without an auth key. The node identity is persisted in `stateDir`.

For short-lived CI jobs, preview environments, and disposable test nodes, pass
`ephemeral: true` to register a node that Tailscale removes after it goes
inactive:

```dart
await Tailscale.instance.up(
  hostname: 'preview-pr-842',
  authKey: 'tskey-auth-...',
  ephemeral: true,
);
```

Use a fresh or cleared `stateDir` for each disposable identity. If `stateDir`
already contains node credentials, `up(ephemeral: true)` reconnects as that
existing node instead of registering a new ephemeral one.

## Feature support

Area | API | Status | Notes
--- | --- | --- | ---
Lifecycle | `init`, `up`, `down`, `logout`, `status` | Supported | `up(ephemeral: true)` supports disposable CI/test nodes; `up()` resolves on the first stable state: running, needs login, or needs machine auth.
Reactive state | `onStateChange`, `onError`, `onNodeChanges` | Supported | Go pushes updates to Dart; callers do not poll.
Node identity | `nodes`, `nodeByIp`, `whois` | Supported | Use stable node IDs for durable references.
Outbound HTTP | `http.client` | Supported | A normal `package:http` client routed through tsnet.
Inbound HTTP | `http.bind` | Supported | Package-native request/response types backed by fd streams.
Raw TCP | `tcp.dial`, `tcp.bind` | Supported | Explicit read/write halves and half-close.
Raw UDP | `udp.bind` | Supported | Message-preserving datagrams with remote endpoint metadata.
TLS listener | `tls.bind`, `tls.domains` | Supported | Requires MagicDNS and HTTPS enabled on the tailnet.
Serve | `serve.forward`, `serve.clear` | Supported | Tailnet-only publication for an existing loopback HTTP server.
Funnel | `funnel.forward`, `funnel.clear` | Supported | Public HTTPS publication through Tailscale Funnel policy.
Tailscale Services | N/A | Planned | Upstream `tsnet.Server.ListenService` is newer than the current `tailscale.com v1.92.2` pin.
Routing controls | `prefs`, `exitNode` | Supported | Subnet routes, Shields Up, tags, hostname, auto-update, and exit nodes.
Diagnostics | `diag` | Supported | Ping, metrics, DERP map, and update checks.
Taildrop | `taildrop` | Planned | Exported as a stub; not implemented in this release.
Profiles | `profiles` | Planned | Exported as a stub; not implemented in this release.
Windows | N/A | Unsupported | v1 is POSIX-only while the Windows data-plane backend is designed.

See [doc/api-status.md](https://github.com/danReynolds/tailscale_dart/blob/main/doc/api-status.md) for the full namespace-by-namespace API map.

## Examples

A few canonical snippets below. The [developer site](https://danreynolds.github.io/tailscale_dart/#examples) hosts the full set covering raw TCP/UDP, TLS termination, Funnel, exit nodes, and routing controls; runnable variants live in [`example/`](https://github.com/danReynolds/tailscale_dart/tree/main/example).

All snippets assume the node has been initialized and started:

```dart
Tailscale.init(stateDir: '/app/state');
await Tailscale.instance.up(authKey: 'tskey-auth-...');
```

### Call a private HTTP service

`http.client` is a standard `package:http` client. Requests resolve MagicDNS and route through the embedded node.

```dart
final response = await Tailscale.instance.http.client.get(
  Uri.parse('http://api.tailnet.example.ts.net/health'),
);

if (response.statusCode != 200) {
  throw StateError('health check failed: ${response.statusCode}');
}
```

### Handle inbound HTTP directly

Use `http.bind` when the handler lives in this Dart process. No localhost proxy is opened.

```dart
final server = await Tailscale.instance.http.bind(port: 8080);

server.requests.listen((request) async {
  await request.respond(
    headers: {'content-type': 'text/plain; charset=utf-8'},
    body: 'hello from ${request.local.address}',
  );
});
```

### Use Shelf middleware directly

The tested adapter in [`example/shelf_adapter.dart`](example/shelf_adapter.dart)
adds a `bindShelf` extension for apps that want Shelf middleware and routing.
Add `shelf` to your app and copy or import the adapter; `package:tailscale`
does not take Shelf as a core dependency.

```dart
import 'package:shelf/shelf.dart';
import 'package:tailscale/tailscale.dart';

import 'shelf_adapter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final handler = const Pipeline()
      .addMiddleware(logRequests())
      .addHandler((Request request) {
        return Response.ok(
          'hello from Shelf over Tailscale',
          headers: {'content-type': 'text/plain; charset=utf-8'},
        );
      });

  final server = await Tailscale.instance.http.bindShelf(
    port: 8080,
    handler: handler,
  );

  print('Shelf listening on ${server.tailnet}');
}
```

### Reuse an existing loopback server

Use `serve.forward` when your app already owns a local HTTP server and you want
to publish that existing loopback port.

```dart
final publication = await Tailscale.instance.serve.forward(
  tailnetPort: 443,
  localPort: 3000,
);

print('tailnet URL: ${publication.url}');
```

`serve.forward` traffic follows Tailscale Serve semantics, including Tailscale
identity headers for tailnet clients. `funnel.forward` follows the same local
server shape for public Funnel publication, but Funnel traffic is public and does
not include Tailscale identity headers.

## Platform support

Platform | Status | Notes
--- | --- | ---
iOS | Supported | Userspace tsnet, no VPN entitlement. Validated with the Flutter smoke app.
Android | Supported | Userspace tsnet, no root. Validated with the Flutter smoke app.
macOS | Supported | Native asset and kqueue reactor path validated locally.
Linux | Supported | Native asset and epoll reactor path validated in Headscale E2E.
Windows | Unsupported | Excluded from the package platform list until a Windows-native backend is designed.

The package is intentionally POSIX-first because owned transports use native descriptors plus a shared kqueue/epoll reactor. Windows needs a different transport backend rather than a thin port of the POSIX implementation.

## Runtime model

```
Dart app
  |
  | typed API calls and streams
  v
FFI worker isolate
  |
  | control ops + fd-backed data-plane handoff
  v
Go tsnet runtime
  |
  | WireGuard, ACLs, MagicDNS, DERP
  v
Tailnet peers
```

Control-plane calls go through a worker isolate so Dart's main isolate does not block on native work. Runtime events come back through Dart ports as streams.

Owned transports (`http.bind`, `tcp.bind`, `udp.bind`, `tls.bind`) use private fd-backed capabilities. That keeps listener ownership inside the package and avoids pretending that a localhost proxy is secure. Forwarding APIs (`serve.forward`, `funnel.forward`) intentionally use loopback because their purpose is to publish an existing local HTTP server the application already owns.

## Roadmap

The core package path is implemented: lifecycle, node identity, HTTP, TCP, UDP, TLS, Serve/Funnel, prefs, exit nodes, diagnostics, Headscale E2E, and hosted-Tailscale live validation. Remaining launch and post-launch work is tracked in the design docs under [`doc/`](https://github.com/danReynolds/tailscale_dart/tree/main/doc) — see [Documentation](#documentation) for the index.
