# API status & usage

Reference for the public API surface of `package:tailscale`, grouped by
namespace. For each namespace: a description, current support status,
purpose, and a copy-pasteable
example. For the forward-looking phase plan, see
[`api-roadmap.md`](api-roadmap.md).

The **core public path** is lifecycle + private HTTP/TCP/UDP/TLS,
Serve/Funnel forwarding, identity, diagnostics, prefs, and exit-node controls.
Optional namespaces remain tracked here, but they do not block a useful release
for embedded Dart apps.

**Legend:**
- ✅ Working — callable today, tested, returns real values.
- ⛔ Stub — typed + documented, throws `UnimplementedError`.

**Convention:** all examples assume `final tsnet = Tailscale.instance;`
and that [`Tailscale.init`](#lifecycle-top-level) has already been called.

**Platform contract:** v1 is POSIX-only: Android, iOS, Linux, and macOS. The
fd-backed data plane depends on native descriptors plus kqueue/epoll. Windows
is intentionally unsupported until a Windows-native backend or fallback carrier
is designed.

**Implementation model:** this package aligns to both upstream
`tsnet.Server` and upstream `local.Client`. Transport primitives such as
HTTP, TCP, UDP, TLS, Funnel, and future service listeners follow
`tsnet`; node introspection, diagnostics, prefs, profiles, serve
config, exit nodes, and taildrop follow LocalAPI via `local.Client`.

**Version note:** the current repo pin is `tailscale.com v1.92.2`. Keep
upstream version skew visible when adding new wrappers.

## Lifecycle (top-level)

Engine lifecycle and reactive streams. These live directly on
`Tailscale.instance` rather than under a namespace because they don't
fit one topic. `up()` resolves on the **first stable state only**
(`running` / `needsLogin` / `needsMachineAuth`) so interactive auth
flows can branch on the returned status without re-calling `up()`. If
startup fails or the implementation gives up waiting before a stable
state is reached, it should throw `TailscaleUpException` rather than
returning a transitional state such as `starting`.

**Status:** fully working.

| API | Status | Description | Example |
| --- | ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| `Tailscale.init({stateDir, logLevel})` | ✅ | One-time library configuration at app startup. | `Tailscale.init(stateDir: '/app/state');` |
| `up({hostname, authKey, ephemeral, controlUrl, timeout})` → `TailscaleStatus` | ✅ | Start engine; `ephemeral: true` registers short-lived CI/test nodes. Resolves on the first stable state only. Throws `TailscaleUpException` if startup fails before that. | `final s = await tsnet.up(authKey: 'tskey-...', ephemeral: true);` |
| `down()` | ✅ | Stop engine, keep persisted credentials. | `await tsnet.down();` |
| `logout()` | ✅ | Stop + wipe persisted credentials. | `await tsnet.logout();` |
| `status()` → `TailscaleStatus` | ✅ | Snapshot: state, IPs, health, MagicDNS suffix. | `final s = await tsnet.status();` |
| `nodes()` → `List<TailscaleNode>` | ✅ | Current node inventory. | `final nodes = await tsnet.nodes();` |
| `nodeByIp(ip)` → `TailscaleNode?` | ✅ | Lookup a known node by Tailscale IP from the current inventory. | `final node = await tsnet.nodeByIp('100.64.0.5');` |
| `onStateChange` → `Stream<NodeState>` | ✅ | Duplicate-filtered state transitions. Repeated `needsLogin` remains observable so callers can refresh `status().authUrl`. | `tsnet.onStateChange.listen(print);` |
| `onError` → `Stream<TailscaleRuntimeError>` | ✅ | Async runtime errors pushed from Go. | `tsnet.onError.listen(report);` |
| `onNodeChanges` → `Stream<List<TailscaleNode>>` | ✅ | Node inventory changes without polling. Replays the current inventory to new subscribers, then emits only when the node list actually changes. | `tsnet.onNodeChanges.listen(render);` |

## `http`

HTTP conveniences layered on top of the tailnet. The `client` routes
every request over the tailnet tunnel; `bind` accepts incoming tailnet
HTTP and exposes package-native request/response objects backed by fd
streams. Shelf users can copy the tested adapter in
[`example/shelf_adapter.dart`](../example/shelf_adapter.dart) to run a
Shelf `Handler` directly on `http.bind` without adding Shelf as a core package
dependency.

**Status:** fully working.

| API | Status | Description | Example |
| --- | ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| `http.client` → `http.Client` | ✅ | Drop-in `http.Client` that tunnels every request. Throws `TailscaleUsageException` before `up()`. | `await tsnet.http.client.get(peerUri);` |
| `http.bind({port})` → `TailscaleHttpServer` | ✅ | Accept tailnet HTTP requests directly. Returns a closable server with the tailnet endpoint and a single-subscription request stream. | `final server = await tsnet.http.bind(port: 80);` |

## `tcp`

Raw TCP between tailnet nodes. Verb split: `dial` for outbound (mirrors
Go's `tsnet.Server.Dial`), `bind` for inbound. Returns package-native
transport types instead of fake `dart:io` sockets: TCP is a full-duplex
`TailscaleConnection` with single-subscription `input` and an explicit
`output` write half.

**Status:** POSIX fd-backed TCP. Go owns tailnet connection
establishment and hands Dart a private fd-backed local capability.

| API | Status | Description | Example |
| --- | ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| `tcp.dial(host, port, {timeout})` → `Future<TailscaleConnection>` | ✅ | Outbound TCP to a tailnet node. `host` may be IP or MagicDNS name. `timeout` bounds the native tailnet dial. | `final c = await tsnet.tcp.dial('100.64.0.5', 22);` |
| `tcp.bind({port, address})` → `Future<TailscaleListener>` | ✅ | Accept inbound TCP. `address` pins to one of this node's tailnet IPs. Pass `0` for `port` to request an ephemeral tailnet port; read it back from `listener.local.port`. | `final l = await tsnet.tcp.bind(port: 1234);` |

## `tls`

TLS-terminated listener with a cert auto-provisioned by the control
plane. Handlers see plaintext bytes — TLS is terminated server-side.

Useful for server-style apps, but not required for the package to be
valuable.

**Status:** implemented with package-native fd-backed listeners.
**Requires:** MagicDNS **and** HTTPS enabled on the tailnet by the
operator. Headscale CI covers only the clear unsupported failure path; live
Tailscale tests cover successful TLS serving against hosted Tailscale.

| API | Status | Description | Example |
| --- | ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| `tls.bind({port, address})` → `Future<TailscaleListener>` | ✅ | TLS-terminated listener with auto-cert. Accepted connections are plaintext package-native streams. | `final l = await tsnet.tls.bind(port: 443);` |
| `tls.domains()` → `Future<List<String>>` | ✅ | Cert SANs; preflight for `bind`. Empty = MagicDNS or HTTPS disabled on the tailnet. | `final sans = await tsnet.tls.domains();` |

## `udp`

UDP datagram bindings over the tailnet. By default, `bind` uses this
node's current IPv4 tailnet address. Pass `address` to bind a specific
local tailnet IP. Datagrams preserve message boundaries and expose the
remote tailnet endpoint on each delivery.

**Status:** POSIX fd-backed UDP.

| API | Status | Description | Example |
| --- | ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| `udp.bind({port, address})` → `Future<TailscaleDatagramBinding>` | ✅ | UDP binding on a tailnet IP of this node. Omits `address` to use this node's IPv4. Pass `0` for an ephemeral local port; read it back from `binding.local.port`. | `final b = await tsnet.udp.bind(port: 4000);` |
| `TailscaleDatagramBinding.datagrams` → `Stream<TailscaleDatagram>` | ✅ | Single-subscription stream of received datagrams. Datagrams may be dropped while no listener is attached or the subscription is paused. | `await for (final d in b.datagrams) print(d.remote);` |
| `TailscaleDatagramBinding.send(bytes, to: endpoint)` | ✅ | Send one datagram. Payloads over 60 KiB are rejected rather than fragmented. | `await b.send(bytes, to: TailscaleEndpoint(address: nodeIp, port: 53));` |

## `funnel`

Public-internet HTTPS via Tailscale Funnel: publish an existing local
HTTP service at this node's Funnel hostname. The package uses upstream
`tsnet.ListenFunnel` for the public listener and proxies requests to the
loopback service.

This is explicitly optional: useful for some hosted/server apps, but
not part of the core embedded-private-network story.

**Status:** implemented for local HTTP forwarding. **Requires:** operator
has enabled HTTPS and Funnel for this node and an allowed Funnel port
(usually 443, 8443, or 10000). Headscale doesn't support Funnel; live
Tailscale test only.

| API | Status | Description | Example |
| --- | ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| `funnel.forward({publicPort, localPort, localAddress, path})` → `Future<TailscalePublishedService>` | ✅ | Publicly publish a local HTTP service through Funnel. | `final p = await tsnet.funnel.forward(localPort: 3000);` |
| `funnel.clear({publicPort, path})` | ✅ | Remove a Funnel publication. | `await tsnet.funnel.clear();` |
| `TailscalePublishedService.close()` | ✅ | Remove the publication created by `forward`. Idempotent per handle. | `await p.close();` |

## `taildrop`

Node-to-node file transfer ("Taildrop") over the tailnet. Sends go
directly between nodes with no intermediary — good fit for
mobile-to-desktop sync, collab tools, anywhere you'd otherwise stand up
a file server. Byte streams use `Stream<Uint8List>` throughout so
producer/consumer can pipe without intermediate buffering.

This remains optional. Upstream Taildrop is still aimed at transfers
between a user's own personal devices, so it is not a strong fit for
generic tagged-node or service-to-service workflows.

**Status:** planned. **Depends on:** the simplest stream-safe
byte path available at the time, likely fd-backed transport or a
LocalAPI-backed byte stream.

| API | Status | Description | Example |
| --- | ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| `taildrop.targets()` → `Future<List<FileTarget>>` | ⛔ | Nodes eligible to receive files right now. | `final ts = await tsnet.taildrop.targets();` |
| `taildrop.push({target, name, data, size?})` | ⛔ | Stream a file to a node. `size` enables receiver progress reporting. | `await tsnet.taildrop.push(target: t, name: 'x', data: bytes);` |
| `taildrop.waitingFiles()` → `Future<List<WaitingFile>>` | ⛔ | Received files not yet picked up. | `final files = await tsnet.taildrop.waitingFiles();` |
| `taildrop.awaitWaitingFiles({timeout})` | ⛔ | Block until at least one file arrives or timeout fires. | `await tsnet.taildrop.awaitWaitingFiles(timeout: ...);` |
| `taildrop.openRead(name)` → `Stream<Uint8List>` | ⛔ | Byte-stream a received file. Caller owns persistence. | `tsnet.taildrop.openRead('x').pipe(sink);` |
| `taildrop.delete(name)` | ⛔ | Discard a received file without reading. | `await tsnet.taildrop.delete('x');` |
| `taildrop.onWaitingFile` → `Stream<WaitingFile>` | ⛔ | Reactive: emits each arriving file. | `tsnet.taildrop.onWaitingFile.listen(save);` |
| `FileTarget` value type | ✅ | Node identity (nodeId, hostname, userLoginName). | `target.hostname == 'laptop'` |
| `WaitingFile` value type | ✅ | Name + size of a received file. | `file.size > 0` |

## `serve`

Programmatic access to what `tailscale serve` / `tailscale funnel` do
on the CLI: HTTP routing and public-internet publishing.

`serve.forward` publishes an existing loopback HTTP server inside the
tailnet. `localAddress` must be loopback (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`, or
`localhost`) so callers cannot accidentally publish arbitrary host-reachable
endpoints. `http.bind()` remains the package-native in-process HTTP server and
should be preferred when the handler lives in Dart and does not need a local TCP
listener.

For tailnet clients, Serve follows upstream Tailscale Serve semantics and
forwards Tailscale identity headers such as `Tailscale-User-Login`,
`Tailscale-User-Name`, and `Tailscale-User-Profile-Pic` to the loopback backend.
Public Funnel traffic does not include those identity headers.

Serve/Funnel publications created by this package are process-scoped rather
than persistent `tailscale serve --bg` configuration. Close the returned
`TailscalePublishedService` explicitly; `Tailscale.down()` also removes
package-created publications best-effort before stopping the embedded node.

**Status:** implemented for local HTTP forwarding. Raw `ServeConfig`
get/set remains a possible future escape hatch.

| API | Status | Description | Example |
| --- | ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| `serve.forward({tailnetPort, localPort, localAddress, path, https})` → `Future<TailscalePublishedService>` | ✅ | Publish a local HTTP service inside the tailnet. | `final p = await tsnet.serve.forward(tailnetPort: 443, localPort: 3000);` |
| `serve.clear({tailnetPort, path})` | ✅ | Remove a tailnet Serve publication. | `await tsnet.serve.clear(tailnetPort: 443);` |
| `TailscalePublishedService` | ✅ | Publication handle with `url`, local target metadata, and `close()`. | `print(p.url); await p.close();` |

## Tailscale Services

Upstream `tsnet.Server.ListenService` advertises a named Tailscale Service from
a tagged node. It is not exposed by this package yet because the current repo pin
is `tailscale.com v1.92.2`, while `ListenService` is a newer upstream API.

**Status:** planned after the Tailscale module pin is bumped and the public Dart
shape is designed.

| API | Status | Description | Example |
| --- | ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| `services.*` | ⛔ | No public Dart API yet. Likely future shape mirrors `tsnet.Server.ListenService` while preserving package-native listener types. | N/A |

## `exitNode`

Route all outbound traffic from this node through another node (VPN-style).
Use `use(node)` when you have a `TailscaleNode` in hand, `useById(id)`
when only the stable ID is durable (persisted across sessions), or
`useAuto()` to let the control plane pick by latency and re-pick on
changes.

Advanced node-control feature; useful, but not central to the core
embedded-app value proposition.

**Status:** implemented. Headscale covers prefs write/read mechanics; the
on-demand live Tailscale suite covers `suggest` / `useAuto` behavior because
recommendation policy is control-plane-specific.

| API | Status | Description | Example |
| --- | ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| `exitNode.current()` → `Future<TailscaleNode?>` | ✅ | Node currently used as exit, or null. | `final cur = await tsnet.exitNode.current();` |
| `exitNode.suggest()` → `Future<TailscaleNode?>` | ✅ | Control-plane-recommended exit (latency-based). | `final s = await tsnet.exitNode.suggest();` |
| `exitNode.use(TailscaleNode)` | ✅ | Route through this node. Type-safe. | `await tsnet.exitNode.use(node);` |
| `exitNode.useById(stableNodeId)` | ✅ | Escape hatch when only the stable ID is available. | `await tsnet.exitNode.useById('nAbCd');` |
| `exitNode.useAuto()` | ✅ | `AutoExitNode` mode — control plane picks and re-picks. | `await tsnet.exitNode.useAuto();` |
| `exitNode.clear()` | ✅ | Stop routing through an exit node. | `await tsnet.exitNode.clear();` |
| `exitNode.onCurrentChange` → `Stream<TailscaleNode?>` | ✅ | React to runtime exit-node selection changes. | `tsnet.exitNode.onCurrentChange.listen(update);` |

## `profiles`

Multi-account / multi-tailnet: one device, several identities. Useful
for a single app operating in both a personal and a work tailnet, or
dev vs prod. `switchTo` accepts a `LoginProfile` (type-safe) or use
`switchToId` when you've persisted only the ID.

Tracked as optional. If the package stays focused on "embed one node in
one app", this may never be a common need.

**Status:** planned.

| API | Status | Description | Example |
| --- | ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| `profiles.current()` → `Future<LoginProfile?>` | ⛔ | Currently active profile, or null on a fresh install. | `final p = await tsnet.profiles.current();` |
| `profiles.list()` → `Future<List<LoginProfile>>` | ⛔ | All profiles persisted on this node. | `final all = await tsnet.profiles.list();` |
| `profiles.switchTo(LoginProfile)` | ⛔ | Disconnect + reconnect with the target profile. | `await tsnet.profiles.switchTo(work);` |
| `profiles.switchToId(id)` | ⛔ | Escape hatch for a persisted ID. | `await tsnet.profiles.switchToId('p1');` |
| `profiles.delete(LoginProfile)` | ⛔ | Remove profile + its persisted credentials. | `await tsnet.profiles.delete(old);` |
| `profiles.deleteById(id)` | ⛔ | Escape hatch for delete by ID. | `await tsnet.profiles.deleteById('p1');` |
| `profiles.newEmpty()` | ⛔ | Create an empty slot for the next `up()` with a fresh authkey. | `await tsnet.profiles.newEmpty();` |
| `LoginProfile` value type | ✅ | `id`, `userLoginName`, `tailnetName`. | `profile.tailnetName == 'acme.com'` |

## `prefs`

The long tail of node preferences — subnet routes, shields, advertised
tags, auto-update opt-in. Common single-field changes have named
setters (`set*` prefix for consistency); atomic multi-field edits use
`updateMasked(PrefsUpdate)`.
Advanced node-control surface rather than core day-one app plumbing.

**Status:** implemented. Headscale covers LocalAPI prefs write/read behavior;
the on-demand live Tailscale suite covers exit-node recommendation policy.

| API | Status | Description | Example |
| --- | ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| `prefs.get()` → `Future<TailscalePrefs>` | ✅ | Current prefs snapshot. | `final p = await tsnet.prefs.get();` |
| `prefs.setAdvertisedRoutes(cidrs)` | ✅ | Replace advertised subnet routes. | `await tsnet.prefs.setAdvertisedRoutes(['10.0.0.0/24']);` |
| `prefs.setAcceptRoutes(bool)` | ✅ | Accept subnet routes from other nodes. | `await tsnet.prefs.setAcceptRoutes(true);` |
| `prefs.setShieldsUp(bool)` | ✅ | Block all inbound connections. | `await tsnet.prefs.setShieldsUp(true);` |
| `prefs.setAutoUpdate(bool)` | ✅ | Opt in/out of tsnet auto-update. | `await tsnet.prefs.setAutoUpdate(true);` |
| `prefs.setAdvertisedTags(tags)` | ✅ | Replace advertised ACL tags. | `await tsnet.prefs.setAdvertisedTags(['tag:prod']);` |
| `prefs.setHostname(hostname)` | ✅ | Change this node's tailnet-visible hostname. | `await tsnet.prefs.setHostname('router');` |
| `prefs.updateMasked(PrefsUpdate)` | ✅ | Atomic multi-field edit; unset fields stay as-is. | `await tsnet.prefs.updateMasked(PrefsUpdate(shieldsUp: true));` |

## `diag`

Observability and diagnostics. Read-only — nothing here affects
connectivity. `ping` is Tailscale's own Disco probe by default (not
ICMP).

**Status:** fully working.

| API | Status | Description | Example |
| --- | ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| `diag.ping(ip, {timeout, type})` → `Future<PingResult>` | ✅ | RTT + route diagnostic. `PingResult.path` distinguishes `direct`, `derp`, and `unknown` when the chosen ping type does not expose enough metadata. `type` is one of `disco` (default, no privileges), `tsmp`, `icmp`. | `final r = await tsnet.diag.ping('100.64.0.5');` |
| `diag.metrics()` → `Future<String>` | ✅ | Prometheus-format metrics snapshot from the embedded runtime. | `print(await tsnet.diag.metrics());` |
| `diag.derpMap()` → `Future<DERPMap>` | ✅ | Current DERP relay map. | `final m = await tsnet.diag.derpMap();` |
| `diag.checkUpdate()` → `Future<ClientVersion?>` | ✅ | Newer version if available, else null. Fields match `tailcfg.ClientVersion` (latestVersion, urgentSecurityUpdate, notifyText). | `final v = await tsnet.diag.checkUpdate();` |
| `PingResult`, `DERPMap`, `DERPRegion`, `DERPNode`, `ClientVersion` value types | ✅ | Immutable returns with `==` / `hashCode`. | `switch (ping.path) { ... }` |

## `whois` (top-level)

Resolve a tailnet IP to node identity (node ID, hostname, owner login,
ACL tags). Lives flat on `Tailscale` rather than under a namespace
because it's a single cross-cutting utility — commonly paired with
`tcp.bind` to authorize inbound connections by tag.

**Status:** fully working.

| API | Status | Description | Example |
| --- | ------ | ----------- | ------- |
| `whois(ip)` → `Future<TailscaleNodeIdentity?>` | ✅ | Identity by tailnet IP; null if not known. | `final id = await tsnet.whois(conn.remoteAddress.address);` |
| `TailscaleNodeIdentity` value type | ✅ | `nodeId`, `hostName`, `userLoginName`, `tags`, `tailscaleIPs`. | `id.tags.contains('tag:trusted')` |

## Errors

Every operation-specific failure extends `TailscaleOperationException`
and carries a structured `TailscaleErrorCode` + optional HTTP
`statusCode`. Callers pattern-match on the exception type (per
namespace) and branch on `code` for outcomes (retry on `conflict`,
surface `featureDisabled`, rethrow otherwise).

**Status:** fully working.

| Type | Status | Thrown by | Example |
| ---- | ------ | --------- | ------- |
| `TailscaleErrorCode` enum | ✅ | `notFound` / `forbidden` / `conflict` / `preconditionFailed` / `featureDisabled` / `unknown`. | `if (e.code == TailscaleErrorCode.conflict) retry();` |
| `TailscaleUsageException` | ✅ | Misuse: `http.client` before `up()`, empty `stateDir`, etc. | `on TailscaleUsageException catch (_) { ... }` |
| `TailscaleUpException` | ✅ | `up()` failed before reaching a stable state. | `on TailscaleUpException catch (e) { showAuth(e); }` |
| `TailscaleHttpException` | ✅ | `http.*`. | `on TailscaleHttpException catch (_) { ... }` |
| `TailscaleStatusException` | ✅ | `status()`. | `on TailscaleStatusException catch (_) { ... }` |
| `TailscaleLogoutException` | ✅ | `logout()`. | `on TailscaleLogoutException catch (_) { ... }` |
| `TailscaleTaildropException` | ✅ | `taildrop.*`. | `on TailscaleTaildropException catch (_) { ... }` |
| `TailscaleServeException` | ✅ | `serve.*` incl. ETag conflicts. | `on TailscaleServeException catch (e) { ... }` |
| `TailscalePrefsException` | ✅ | `prefs.*`. | `on TailscalePrefsException catch (_) { ... }` |
| `TailscaleProfilesException` | ✅ | `profiles.*`. | `on TailscaleProfilesException catch (_) { ... }` |
| `TailscaleExitNodeException` | ✅ | `exitNode.*`. | `on TailscaleExitNodeException catch (_) { ... }` |
| `TailscaleDiagException` | ✅ | `diag.*`. | `on TailscaleDiagException catch (_) { ... }` |
| `TailscaleRuntimeError` (not `Exception`) | ✅ | Async errors pushed from Go via `onError`. | `tsnet.onError.listen((e) => report(e));` |
