![CodeWalk Logo](assets/images/logo.256.png)

A native (really fast!!) cross-platform client for [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) server mode. Built with Flutter, it provides a conversational interface for session-based AI coding interactions over HTTP APIs and streaming events.

> 🏷️ **New in v1.244.0:** Assistant replies now render basic HTML formatting and native progress bars. [See supported tags and examples](#basic-html-in-assistant-replies).

> 📰 **New:** CodeWalk now runs right in your browser — open https://codewalk.verseles.com, add your OpenCode server profile, and start chatting. No install needed.
>
> Your OpenCode server must allow the web origin, otherwise the browser blocks the connection:
>
> ```bash
> opencode serve --cors "https://codewalk.verseles.com"
> ```

## Basic HTML in Assistant Replies

<details>
<summary>Supported tags and examples</summary>

Assistant replies can mix these case-insensitive HTML tags with Markdown. Formatting and progress bars follow the app theme on mobile and desktop.

| Tag | Effect | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<b>` | Bold | `<b>Important</b>` |
| `<i>` | Italic | `<i>Note</i>` |
| `<u>` | Underline | `<u>Highlighted</u>` |
| `<br>` | Line break; `<br/>` and `<br />` also work | `First line<br>Second line` |
| `<sub>` | Subscript | `H<sub>2</sub>O` |
| `<sup>` | Superscript | `x<sup>2</sup>` |
| `<progress>` | Native progress bar | `<progress value="25" max="100">Loading</progress>` |

Formatting tags can nest, for example `<b><i>Bold and italic</i></b>`. Progress defaults to `max="1"`; omit `value` for an indeterminate bar, such as `<progress></progress>`. Explicitly self-closing progress tags also work.

Tags inside code examples stay literal, and copying the whole message preserves its source markup. Underline/subscript/superscript decoration is omitted in Markdown link labels to keep links clickable. Support is limited to the tags above; arbitrary HTML and CSS are not rendered.

## Install in One Command

Install using the `install.cat` pattern:

- Linux & macOS

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL install.cat/verseles/codewalk | sh
  ```

- Windows (PowerShell)

  ```powershell
  irm install.cat/verseles/codewalk | iex
  ```

Run the same command again any time to update/reinstall to the latest GitHub release.

Installers automatically pick the right release for your platform.

On Linux, release files are installed under
`${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/codewalk-app`, separately from user data.
Existing installations keep their preferences and caches in the legacy
`codewalk` support directory; fresh installations use `com.verseles.codewalk`.
Updates and uninstall remove application files without deleting either user-data
directory.

- Android

  Open this in your Android browser to download the APK:
  [install.cat/verseles/codewalk](https://install.cat/verseles/codewalk)

### Uninstall

- Linux & macOS

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/verseles/codewalk/main/uninstall.sh | sh
  ```

- Windows (PowerShell)

  ```powershell
  irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/verseles/codewalk/main/uninstall.ps1 | iex
  ```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (>=3.8.1)
- Dart SDK
- An OpenCode-compatible server instance
- Platform toolchain for your target:
  - Linux desktop: `clang`, `cmake`, `ninja`, `pkg-config`
  - Windows desktop: build from a Windows host
  - macOS desktop: build from a macOS host

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. Run the app (examples):

   ```bash
   flutter run -d linux
   flutter run -d chrome
   flutter run -d android
   ```

3. Build artifacts (examples):
   ```bash
   flutter build linux
   flutter build web
   ```

### Make Targets

```bash
make check      # deps + codegen + analyze + coverage-tool fixtures + full tests
make check-fast # same setup, with the fast test selection
make test-fast  # excludes slow/integration; includes ChatPage smoke scenarios
make test-chat  # ChatPage smoke + extended scenarios
make test-web   # browser capability tests; requires Chrome/Chromium
make test-coverage-tools # LCOV validation and threshold regression fixtures
make coverage   # full tests with coverage + global and protected-file floors
make web        # build Flutter web app into build/web
make android    # build arm64 APK
make release V=patch # bump pubspec, update CHANGELOG.md, commit, tag, push
#   ANNOUNCE="text" embeds an optional What's-new announcement (or answer the prompt)
```

Use focused tests while iterating and `make check` at stable validation gates. Test targets default to four workers; override with `TEST_JOBS=N` when appropriate for the host. `make test-fast` retains the five ChatPage smoke scenarios while the extended suite remains required in full checks. Browser tests run separately via `make test-web` and in CI; set `CHROME_EXECUTABLE` if the browser is not discovered automatically.

Coverage filtering uses Python 3 and does not require system `lcov`. The gate validates fresh Flutter LCOV records, excludes `.g.dart`, localization, and plugin registrant sources, and enforces the global floor plus the reviewed per-file floors in `tool/ci/coverage_baseline.tsv`. Missing protected sources, inconsistent totals, foreign source paths, or coverage below the configured floors fail the gate; an old filtered artifact is never used as a fallback. Floors are changed deliberately, not regenerated or lowered automatically.

When you need a testable Android artifact, run `HEY_CAPTION="specific caption" make android` after checks pass.

### Web Deploy: Cloudflare Pages or Static Hosting

CodeWalk's web build is a static Flutter app. The build does not need Cloudflare secrets or compile-time OpenCode credentials; users add their OpenCode server profile inside the app after opening the deployed site.

1. Build the web app:

   ```bash
   make web
   ```

   This runs `flutter build web --release --base-href "/"` and writes the static site to `build/web`.

2. For a subpath deployment, set a base href that starts and ends with `/`:

   ```bash
   WEB_BASE_HREF="/codewalk/" make web
   ```

3. Preview the static output locally for root-hosted builds:

   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory build/web
   ```

   If you build with a subpath `WEB_BASE_HREF`, preview it under the same path prefix; otherwise browser asset URLs will not match the local server root.

4. Publish `build/web` to Cloudflare Pages.

   Direct upload with Wrangler:

   ```bash
   npx wrangler pages deploy build/web --project-name codewalk
   ```

   Cloudflare Pages Git settings, if your Pages build image has Flutter available:

   ```text
   Build command: make web
   Build output directory: build/web
   Root directory: (leave blank)
   ```

5. Configure the OpenCode server that the browser app will connect to. For a Pages deployment at `https://your-codewalk.pages.dev`, allow that exact origin:

   ```bash
   export OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD="choose-a-password"
   opencode serve --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port 4096 --cors "https://your-codewalk.pages.dev"
   ```

6. Add a CodeWalk server profile in the web app using your reachable server URL and Basic Auth credentials.

Known limitations:

- An HTTPS-hosted CodeWalk site cannot call a plain HTTP OpenCode server on a LAN IP because browsers block mixed content. Use HTTPS for the OpenCode origin, a trusted reverse proxy/tunnel, or run the CodeWalk web build from a local HTTP origin during private testing.
- CORS must allow the exact CodeWalk origin when Basic Auth or other credentials are used; do not rely on wildcard CORS for authenticated browser requests.
- The OpenCode server URL must be reachable from the user's browser, not from Cloudflare's build system.

### Server Configuration

1. Launch the app and open **Settings** from the sidebar
2. Tap **Add Server** and run the Quick setup command in your terminal
3. Keep the default `Server URL` (`http://127.0.0.1:4096`) or set your server URL
4. Configure Basic Auth only if your server requires it
5. Save and switch active/default profiles as needed

### OpenCode Project Agent

When you run OpenCode from this repository, the repo ships a project agent at `.opencode/agents/opencodeNews.md`:

- `@opencodeNews` reviews the latest OpenCode release for CodeWalk impact
- `@opencodeNews review vX.Y.Z` or `@opencodeNews check https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/releases/tag/...` reviews a specific release target mentioned in the same prompt

The agent returns a release summary, impact/risk by area, proposed adjustments, and an execution plan only when CodeWalk work is needed.

## Architecture

The project follows Clean Architecture with three layers: Domain, Data, and Presentation. Dependency injection via `get_it`, HTTP via `dio`, state management via `provider`.
